### What is Tic Stac Toe
A React Web Application that is tic tac toe, but cooler! Instead of Xs and Os, each player has different sized pieces that they can stack. If the other player takes a spot, you can steal it from them if you have a bigger piece by stacking it.

### What did I learn?
- Firebase: I used a Firebase Realtime Database to keep track of the game pieces, players, and the room the players are in. This let me make it an online multiplayer game. 
- react-dnd: I wanted to add drag and drop functionality to allow for easier stacking. I followed the tutorial here: https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/tutorial
